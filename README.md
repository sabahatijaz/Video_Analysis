# Video_Analysis
Video Analysis and Unique Frame Extraction

This Python application harnesses the power of the CLIP model and advanced image processing techniques to conduct in-depth video analysis and extract truly unique frames. By intelligently filtering out duplicates and noise, this tool ensures that the frames captured are of the highest quality, making it ideal for applications like image recognition, object detection, and more.
Features

    CLIP Model Integration: Utilizes the cutting-edge CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model from OpenAI for robust image similarity comparisons.
    Smart Frame Extraction: Extracts frames from videos with precision, employing a dual-layer validation process involving CLIP similarity and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).
    Dynamic Thresholds: Allows you to set custom similarity thresholds for both CLIP model comparisons and SSIM, providing flexibility based on your specific use case.
    Real-time Feedback: Displays a progress bar using tqdm, keeping you informed about the analysis and extraction progress.
    Efficient Handling of Large Datasets: Optimized to handle large video datasets, ensuring efficient processing even with extensive files.
    User-friendly Configuration: Offers an intuitive configuration process through environment variables, allowing easy adjustment of parameters without diving into the code.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

    Python 3.6 or higher
    FFmpeg: Required for video processing. Download it here.

Installation

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone <repository-url>
cd video-analysis-and-extraction

Install Dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Configuration (.env file):

    Create a .env file in the project directory with the following variables:

    plaintext

Video_Similarity_Threshold=0.9
SSIM_Video=0.8

Adjust the thresholds according to your requirements.

Run the Application:

bash

    python main.py

    The application will process the video specified in videos/random.mp4, extract valid frames, and store them in the UnblurrNUnique directory.

Advanced Configuration

    Video_Similarity_Threshold: Similarity threshold for CLIP model comparisons (0 to 1).
    SSIM_Video: Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) threshold for video frames (0 to 1).

Example Use Cases

    Media Production: Extract unique frames for compelling visuals in films and advertisements.
    Research and Analysis: Analyze video content for research purposes, ensuring data accuracy.
    Security and Surveillance: Enhance security systems by processing surveillance footage intelligently.
    Artificial Intelligence: Provide high-quality training data for machine learning models.
    Virtual Reality: Create immersive VR experiences by using unique frames for realistic environments.
